1) A plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like 2D sheet and 3D box. The cost of sheet is Rs 40 per sqr ft and the cost of box is Rs 60 per cu ft. 
   Implement it in java to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user where 3D inherits from 2D.
2) Illustrate the execution of constructors in multilevel inheritance with 3 Java classes -
   i)plate(length,width)
   ii) box(length, width,height)
   iii)wood_Box(length,width,height,thick)
3) WAP to demonstrate dynamic method dispatch.(execute the program what you have done in the class)
4) WAP to define a class Shape which has data member area and a member function so_area(). Derive 2 classes Circle and Rectangle from Shape. Add appropriate data member
   and member functions to calculate and display the area of Circle and Rectangle. [Use method overloading]
5) WAP to create an Account Class containing account_no, balance as data members and display function to display the details. Inherit it in Person class with all 
   mentioned data members and functions. Person class has name and Aadhar no as extra data members. Override display function. Create 5 Persons details.
6) WAP using inheritance to show how to call the base class parameterised constructor from derived class using Super.
