1) WAP using inheritance to show how to call the base class parameterised constructor from derived class using Super
2) Illustrate the execution of constructors in a multilevel inheritance with 3 JAVA classes
   i) plate(length, width)
   ii) box(length, width, height)
   iii) wood_Box(length, width, height, thick)
3) WAP to demonstrate dynamic method dispatch
4) WAP to define class "Shape" which has a data member area and a member function so_area(). Derive 2 classes "Cirle" and "Rectangle" from Shape. Add appropriate data
   members and member functions to calculate and display the area of circle and rectangle using method overloading.
5) WAP to create an "Account" class containing account_no, balance as data members and display() function to display the details. Inherit it in "Person" class with all
   mentioned data members and functions. Person class has a name and Aadhar_no as extra data members. Override display function. Use this to display 5 person details
6) A plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like 2D sheet and 3D box. The cost of sheet is Rs. 40 per sqr ft and the cost of box is Rs. 60 per sqr ft.
   Implement it in JAVA to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user where 3D inherits from 2D.
